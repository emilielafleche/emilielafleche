- 👋 Hi, I’m @emilielafleche, a PhD student in Planetary Sciences at Purdue EAPS.
- 👀 I’m interested in astrobiology - specifically, I'm researching seasonality as a potential exoplanet biosignature :)
- 🌱 I’m currently using cGENIE-PlaSim, a 3D biogeochemical model coupled to an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM).
- 👩🏻‍🚀 I’m also an analog astronaut and the Geological Research Coordinator at LunAres Research Station in Poland. 
- 🚀 Project GRAVELS (Geological Research and Analyses Via EVA Lunar Sample Collection) is my brainchild and was started during my LunAres mission!
- 📫 How to reach me: elaflech@purdue.edu
